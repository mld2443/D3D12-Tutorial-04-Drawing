# Tutorial 04: Drawing
This tutorial is currently a work in progress. This particular tutorial will eventually be part 4, but it is currently a prototype of my implementation and style. Check the issues for info about progress toward completion.

## Motivation
This project was inspired by [RasterTek](http://rastertek.com/tutindex.html) where I found excellent tutorials on DirectX 11, and who started working on DirectX 12, but stopped abruptly for some reason. He didn't get very far, and so it's my intent to pick up where he left off, and do a DirecX 12 tutorial my way.

## Other Resources

* [PuzzleBobble](https://github.com/mld2443/PuzzleBobble): My own dubiously functional attempt to make a DirectX 11 game, where I expand on some RasterTek tutorials to do some interesting things.
* [BraynzarSoft](https://www.braynzarsoft.net/viewtutorial/q16390-04-directx-12-braynzar-soft-tutorials): The reference material here does an excellent job illustrating and explaining DirectX 12 concepts.
